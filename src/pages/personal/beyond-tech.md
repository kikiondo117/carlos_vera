Hi, this is a small page about my hobbies and interests beyond tech and programming, I will be continuously updating this page with new information 🧑‍💻

# Hobbies

- 🏍️ I love to drive my motorcycles and discover new places. I try to do it every month at least once.
- 🎧 Really like to mix music and I have my own brand call kikis 404
- 📻 I have a small project with my family to make a radio station online.

## Personal Projects

My plan is create a website to **share** my knowledge about web development, this is my first project with this stack, I really love Remix (React) but Astro is a good tool to create static websites and blogs 🥳.

In the future I will create a web project to sell courses about React and JavaScript. Why? Because I want to help people to learn those technologies easily, right now exist a lot of courses but they are not easy to find and to use 🧑‍🏫.

Looks like all is about technology but I have other plans like continue traveling in my motorcycle, help the companies to make accessible websites and resolve new challenges 🧙‍♂️.
